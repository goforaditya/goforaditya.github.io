  <section><h1 id="joystick-the-gaming-console">üïπÔ∏èThe Gaming Console</h1>
<p>I love domain-specific tech products ‚Äî gaming consoles, tactical input accessories, and other devices that feel like they belong in a niche but powerful world. There‚Äôs something about holding a piece of hardware that‚Äôs designed for one thing and does it really well. That‚Äôs the spirit behind Sololibrary ‚Äî a side project born out of my love for tinkering, learning, and simplifying complex knowledge into hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>On YouTube I stumbled upon a few cyberdeck builds and Raspberry Pi gaming consoles ‚Äî sleek, powerful, DIY devices people had put together to serve a specific purpose.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The videos were like a rabbit hole. I kept thinking: "What if I could build something like this, but instead of retro games, it taught you how to make money?".</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Raspberry_Pi_TFT_screen_running_some_code.jpg/960px-Raspberry_Pi_TFT_screen_running_some_code.jpg" alt="A Typical RaspberryPi build looks like heaven to me" /></p>
<p>When I was a kid, the moment my grandfather got his first Samsung smartphone, I grabbed a screwdriver and took it apart ‚Äî no clue what was inside, but I was fascinated. That curiosity stuck. Today, I‚Äôm into data engineer and data science at my day job which is getting boring, and I want to share what I know in a way that clicks for people ‚Äî especially those who aren‚Äôt from a technical background.</p>
<p>So I have decided to build a learning console. A Raspberry Pi-powered device that boots into a gamified interface and lets people explore modules like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to automate trades in the stock market</li>
<li>Mathematical approaches to gambling</li>
<li>Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis with real use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more modules to come...</p>
<h2 id="the-metalog">The Metalog</h2>
<p>I tend to loose motivation a lot between side projects and just fall into to rabbitholes like "Let's look at Youtube videos which explain the Chinese chip maufacturing ecosystem" instead of actually working on projects. So I have decided that I would need a blog documenting this journey. Mostly beacause it might be a more fun read for future me when I am curious or wanting to pass some time. Also I would accompany this with Youtube Shorts and Tweets to keep me interested in the project and make me proud of the progress I am making.</p>
<p>If I somehow I get good maybe more people can be taught on how to contribute to this project. Ahh! our own little community that would be so nice. But coming back to reality, I plan on documenting everything I stumble upon for this first as devnotes and then blogs to videos. I am also a complete idiot and have a full time job so that makes me very unproductive. That's like I guess.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>As of now It looks like there are three major components needed to get this to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Tech</li>
<li>Device</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>I plan on making video games/interactive tutorials to teach the above skills. So first I need to create a lesson plan and start teaching stuff. I'll use this space and notes when learning. And will create a well structured lesson plan and tutorials here as a seperate section as well as a MOOC style webapp seperately.</p>
<p>Also then once I have the content ready as a post/video. Next step is to start development on the game aspect. For this <a href="https://ctjs.rocks/">CT.JS</a> looks promising given my novoice level skills. I will create small interactive pieces to go along with the webapp.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<p>Need to develop a FullStack learning app which is also a Game (think MOOC + MMORPG). I don't know what tech stack I should use. I am not a full stack guy just a novoice. Have worked with Next.JS and Rails in the past maybe will try to do this with them somehow. The idea is for me to make learning a fun experience for me and anyone who visits the website. Also this can double up as source of content for the YouTube channel. I can livestream going through the challenges.</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure this is more Game/OS than a typical learning website with a lesson based UI. No I need to make it less boring and more fun.</p>
<h2 id="device">Device</h2>
<p>Once I have a decent WebApp (Tauri)[https://v2.tauri.app/], (FlutterFlow)[], (Hotwire Native)[https://native.hotwired.dev/] can help me convert it to an App.</p>
<p>I can run a Linux distro in VirtualBox to create an image that runs the App like a Kiosk/default and just allows some basic functionalities outside the app core. Connecting to Wifi, taking notes, System settings etc., Long term goal is for the App itself to become the GUI layer for the Linux operating system without needing to switch to anything else.</p>
<p>For the pyshical device it will have.</p>
<ol>
<li>A keyboard. Can directly use Raspberry Pi 500 for this.</li>
<li>A screen. I.e. it will be a cyberdeck.</li>
<li>I/O. Option to add a monitor and open USB and GPIO for extensibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Optionally will create dedicated version of internet platform Apps using opensource tech. A Browser. An IDE, a dedicated mastodon, A Q&amp;A platform (Apache Answer)[https://github.com/apache/answer], Realtime P2P messaging. Interest Forums etc,. Also thinking of adding multiple modes of connectivity WiFi and LTE for courses. And BlueTooth and Ham Radio for Device to Device comms.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start building the app.</li>
<li>Start reading up and writing about financial engineering.</li>
<li>Create first youtube shorts and video. Explaining this to everyone.</li>
<li>Update X on the progress. Make it a #100DaysOfCode challenge.</li>
</ul>
